# Digital Store Audit
 Retail managers often perform multiple store audit walkthroughs a day, generating substantial amounts of paper-based, unused data. As a mobile-first platform with robust process automation tools, Salesforce can be an integral part of a retail Store Operations strategy. By collecting data with an intuitive end-user experience in Salesforce, we can provide real-time insight with standard Reports & Dashboards, expand business process automation, and all the other features you’ve come to love about working on the Salesforce Platform.

While this Flow Template was inspired with retail store operations use cases in mind, we can imagine this Audit Configuration framework being flexible for a range of industries and use cases - equipment inspections, event walk-throughs, quality assurance, safety checklists, and more.

Any business with a checklist or rating form should review this Flow Template to help collect and make use of the data.

◆ Intuitive end-user experience that guides through complex steps

◆ Flexible Flow Template allows you to create multiple Audit Configurations, supporting the range of requirements across your team

◆ By moving away from paper, you collect more accurate and complete data. Your team can even attach photos on every step

◆ Once the data is stored in Salesforce, you can provide real-time insight with standard Reports & Dashboards or further automate your business processes
